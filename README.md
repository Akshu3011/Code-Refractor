# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Challenges 01

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

## Challenge Resolution

Steps that I followed to achieve codebase that follows accessibility standards which is optimized for search engines
1. Worked on the Wireframe to decide the semntics
2. Replaced basic html tags like div to Semantic tags
3. Added the imgage in the HTML file instead of CSS
4. Created header and nav tags for navigation bar and title
5. Added different sections for the different information boxes
6. Added side for the sidebar
7. Added footer
8. updated CS file to remove the redundant code
